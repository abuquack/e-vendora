  - Multiple payment gateways integration.
  - Order confirmation and receipt via email.

- **Reviews & Ratings:**
  - Customers can leave reviews and ratings on products.
  - Moderation tools for vendors/admins to manage reviews.

### **2. Additional Features:**

## 2. **User Stories**

To ensure we cover all functionalities, we'll define user stories for the different roles: **Admin**, **Vendor**, and **Customer**. User stories are short descriptions of features from the perspective of the user.

### **Admin User Stories:**

1. As an **admin**, I want to approve or reject vendor registrations so that only verified vendors can sell.
2. As an **admin**, I want to manage product categories to keep the product catalog organized.
3. As an **admin**, I want to view overall sales, number of users, and vendor performance to monitor the platform's health.

### **Vendor User Stories:**

1. As a **vendor**, I want to add, edit, or remove products to manage my store.
2. As a **vendor**, I want to view my orders and update their status (e.g., shipped) to keep customers informed.
3. As a **vendor**, I want to track my sales and revenue to monitor my store's performance.

### **Customer User Stories:**

1. As a **customer**, I want to browse products by category or vendor so that I can find what I want.
2. As a **customer**, I want to add products to my cart and checkout so that I can make a purchase.
3. As a **customer**, I want to leave reviews for products so I can share my feedback with others.

## 3. **Project Planning and Tasks Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Design (Figma)**

Before jumping into the code, let's create some wireframes and high-fidelity designs in **Figma**.

#### Tasks:

1. **Landing Page Design** (Home, featured products, categories).
2. **Vendor Dashboard Wireframe** (Product management, order view).
3. **Customer Dashboard Wireframe** (Cart, wishlist, order history).
4. **Product Page Design** (Product details, reviews).
5. **Admin Panel Wireframe** (Vendor approvals, site stats).
6. **Authentication Pages** (Login, register).

---

### **Phase 2: Backend Architecture (Golang)**

This phase focuses on building the API and database in **Golang**. The system will have three main layers:

- **Router/Controllers**: Handling HTTP requests.
- **Service Layer**: Business logic.
- **Data Access Layer**: Database interactions (CRUD).

#### 1. **Initial Setup:**

- Setup Golang with necessary libraries like **gin** for routing, **gorm** for ORM, ~and **jwt-go** for JWT authentication~ WE WONT USE JWT.

#### 2. **Database Schema Design (PostgreSQL)**

We will use PostgreSQL for relational database management. Here are the main tables:

- **Users**: (id, email, password, role: [admin, vendor, customer], created_at).
- **Vendors**: (id, user_id, store_name, logo, description, status: [approved, pending]).
- **Products**: (id, vendor_id, title, description, price, stock, category_id, created_at).
- **Categories**: (id, name, created_at).
- **Orders**: (id, user_id, status: [pending, shipped, delivered], total_price, created_at).
- **OrderItems**: (id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price).
- **Reviews**: (id, product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at).
- **Cart**: (id, user_id, product_id, quantity).

│   └── auth_controller.go
│   └── product_controller.go
│   └── vendor_controller.go
